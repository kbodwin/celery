## A brief introduction to the k-means algorithm

*k-means* is a method of *unsupervised* learning that produces a partitioning of
observations into *k* unique clusters.  The goal of *k-means* is to minimize the sum of
squared Euclidian distances between observations in a cluster and the **centroid**,
or geometric mean, of that cluster.

In *k-means* clustering, observed variables (columns) are considered to be locations
on orthogonal axes in multidimensional space.  For example, in the plot below,
each point represents an observation of one penguin, and the location in 2-dimensional
space is determined by the bill length and bill depth of that penguin.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
```


A *k-means* cluster assignment is achieved by iterating to convergence from random
initial conditions.  The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Choose *k* random observations in the dataset.  These locations in space are
declared to be the **initial centroids**.

```{r}
init <- penguins %>%
  sample_n(3)

centroids = factor(1:3)

  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = penguins$bill_length_mm, y = penguins$bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = init$bill_length_mm, y = init$bill_depth_mm, color = clusters), size = 5)
```

2. Assign each observation to the nearest centroid.

[pic - we should have automatic functions for this.  if I could predict with
pre-supplied centroids that would be cool.]

3. Compute the new centroids of each cluster.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change.

#### Things to note

* Because *k-means* relies on random initial conditions, the procedure may not
result in identical cluster assignments on subsequent runs.

* Because *k-means* is a greedy algorithm, it is not guaranteed to achieve a
globally optimal solution.

* *k-means* produces a **partition**: each observation is assigned to exactly 
one cluster

* *k-means* is a **non-stochastic** approach; no probability model is assumed
regarding the selection of the observations or the values of the variables.


## k-means specification in {celery}

To specify a k-means model in `celery`, simply choose a value of $k$ and an
engine:

```{r}
kmeans_spec <- k_means(k = 3) %>%
  set_engine_celery("stats") 

kmeans_spec
```

Once specified, a model may be "fit" to a dataset by providing a formula and 
data frame.  Note that unlike in supervised modeling, the formula should not
include a response variable.

```{r}
kmeans_spec_fit <- kmeans_spec %>%
  fit(~ bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm, data = penguins)

kmeans_spec_fit
```

To access the only the results produced by the engine - in this case, `stats::kmeans` -
simply extract the fit from the fitted model object:

```{r}
kmeans_spec_fit$fit
```


#### Cluster centroids

A cluster is typically characterized by the location of its
final centroid.  These can be accessed by:

```{r}
kmeans_spec_fit %>%
  extract_clusters()
```

[interpretation]



#### Cluster assignments and predictions

Of the information provided from the model fit, the primary objective is typically
the cluster assignments of each observation.  These can be accessed via the
`extract_cluster_assignment()` function:

```{r}
kmeans_spec_fit %>%
  extract_cluster_assignment()
```

Note that this function renames clusters in accordance with the standard `celery`
naming convention and ordering: clusters are named "Clust1", "Clust2", etc.
and are numbered by the order they appear in the rows of the training dataset.

Similarly, you can "predict" the cluster membership of new data using the 
`predict_cluster()` function:

```{r}
new_penguin <- tibble(
  bill_length_mm = 40,
  bill_depth_mm = 15
)

kmeans_spec_fit %>%
  predict_cluster(new_penguin)
```

In the case of `kmeans`, the cluster assignment is predicted by finding the closest
final centroid to the new observation.

[Still under development:  This does not yet respect the cluster naming convention.]

#### Augmenting datasets

To attach cluster assignments or predictions to a dataset, use `augment_cluster()`:

```{r}
### add this
```


## Workflows

```{r}
penguins_recipe_1 <- recipe(~ bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm,
                            data = penguins)

penguins_recipe_2 <- recipe(species ~ bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm,
                            data = penguins)

# wflow_1 <- workflow() %>%
#   add_celery_model(kmeans_spec) %>%
#   add_recipe(penguins_recipe_1)
```
